### Provision AWS IoT Device

Let's start by setting up a device in AWS IoT service.

#### Creating Policy
- [Sign in](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) into the AWS Console
- In the find service section, search for the service `IoT Core`
- On the left hand navigation, click to expand `Secure` and then select `Policies`
- Click `Create` in the top right corner of the screen
- In the create policy screen, click `Advanced mode`
- Provide a policy name e.g. `MySmarthomePolicy`
- In the below JSON. replace the `<REGION>` with your AWS account region, `<ACCOUNT_NUMBER>` with your AWS [Account Id](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/account) and `<THING_NAME>` with the name of the AWS thing you will create e.g. `smarthome`

- Paste the policy text into the text box and click `Create`

#### Creating a Thing
- On the left hand navigation, click to expand `Manage` and then select `Thing`
- Click `Create` in the top right corner of the screen
- Click `Create a single thing` button in the next screen
- Provide a name for the things e.g. `smarthome`. This should be the same name as used during policy creation
- Click `Next`
- Click `Create certificate` in front of One-click certificate creation (recommended)
- Download all the 3 certificate files for your thing (public, private and certificate) and save them into `certs` folder
- Click `Active` button to activate the root CA for AWS IoT
- Download the root CA certificate for AWS IoT from [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/server-authentication.html#server-authentication-certs) and save it into `certs` folder
- Click `Attach a policy` button and select the policy `MySmarthomePolicy` you created in the above section
- Click `Register thing` to finish Thing creation
- Once the Thing is created, open the thing details and click `Interact` in the left hand navigation
- Make a note of the value of `REST API Endpoint` under the HTTPS section for later use. 
e.g. `xxxxxxxxxxxxxx-ats.iot.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`
We will use this endpoint to interact with the Thing later in the process. 

At this point, we are all set to to communicate with the Thing.
